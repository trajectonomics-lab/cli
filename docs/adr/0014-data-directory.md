# Data lives in one directory at `~/.traj`

All state is one directory, `~/.traj`, holding `traj.db`. It is resolved through `os.homedir()` on every platform and overridden by `TRAJ_HOME`. One path that is identical on Linux, macOS and Windows means an agent skill can hardcode it, `--help` prints a single string, and tests isolate with `TRAJ_HOME=$(mktemp -d)` instead of branching per operating system.

## Considered options

XDG — `$XDG_DATA_HOME/traj`, defaulting to `~/.local/share/traj` — is the polite convention on Linux, but it only helps the users who actually set `XDG_DATA_HOME`, and macOS and Windows still need their own branch. Platform-native paths (`~/Library/Application Support/…`, `%APPDATA%\…`) triple the surface for a tool whose users are agents that read `--help` once and then hardcode what it said.

This is hard to reverse once anyone has data in it, which is why it is recorded rather than left to the implementation.
