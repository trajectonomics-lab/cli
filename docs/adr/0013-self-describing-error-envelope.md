# The error envelope names its own exit class, and one registry defines every code

A JSON error is `{"error":{"code","exitCode","message","path?","hint?","details?"}}`: the string `code` identifies the failure, and the numeric `exitCode` names its class. Both come from one CLI-owned registry keyed `Record<ErrorCode, { exit, message }>`, typed so a single code can never carry two classes — a situation that needs two classes is two codes. Commands return a `Result` or an `AppError` and never a bare number, so `fail()` is the only path that produces an error and the envelope's `exitCode` and the process exit status are the same lookup. `traj schema` prints the registry sorted by code; `traj schema <command>` lists the codes that command raises by reference, because global codes such as `unknown_flag` fire before any command is resolved.

## Considered options

Carrying only the string `code` and letting `traj schema` publish the mapping was rejected as the obvious-but-wrong choice. The mapping only helps a caller that already holds it, and a caller meeting a code it has never seen — from a CLI newer than its own — is exactly the caller that needs the class. `$?` cannot stand in for it either: `traj … --json | jq` reports `jq`'s status, and a future MCP tool result carries the payload but not the exit status.

The redundancy objection against duplicating the class does not apply here, because both values are derived from one table rather than maintained by hand, and `fail()` is the only writer.

## Consequences

Consumers will branch on the coarse `exitCode` and ignore `code`, so reclassifying a code later is a wire-format break rather than a `$?` change nobody checks. Get the classes right before the MCP server ships, and record each code's class in the registry rather than only in behaviour.

The envelope is not fully self-contained for failures that kill the process before the registry runs — out-of-memory, a native `bun:sqlite` panic, a segfault. Those exit 1 with text on stderr. The `internal` catch-all is a fixed string with diagnostics behind `TRAJ_DEBUG=1`, so the bytes never vary by runtime, path or version.
